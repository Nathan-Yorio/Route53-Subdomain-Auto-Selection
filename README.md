- Run the Python Script
`python main.py`
The python script that uses boto3 to grab information about the currently saved AWS CLI account, which is then stored in a tfvars file that terraform uses to create the subdomain pointed at the load balancer that is selected

`terraform validate`
`terraform apply -var-file="default.tfvars"`
Initialize Terraform, validate that the script is good to go and apply the script using the tfvars file that was generated by the python script.
